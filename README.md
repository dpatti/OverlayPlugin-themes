  so that, e.g., a BLM spamming Umbral Soul isn't at 100% uptime.
- meters: have a dual-bar setup for visualizing healing vs overhealing
- timers: add more buff/debuff data
- timers: make buff/debuff selection configurable
- timers: if possible, reset the state when a wipe happens
- timers: show how many targets multi-target actions hit
- timers: more distinct effect when a buff window starts
- countdown: smoother bar
- meta: do a pass to clean up CSS
